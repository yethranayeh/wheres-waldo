# Where's Waldo?

This a `React` web app version of the traditional _Where's Waldo?_ game, built for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

## How to play?

There is currently 1 image with 2 characters available to play. Each character that you need to find can be seen in the sidebar (if you are on mobile you need to click the burger menu toggle to see it).

After you click the `Start` button, you can click anywhere on the image to make guess as to where the characters are located. The aim of the game is to find all characters as quickly as possible.

## Missing Features

This project is still a `work-in-progress`. Thus, it has some features missing that are intended to be added in the future builds, such as:

- Server-side timer
- Leaderboards for global competition as well as individual run history for players.
